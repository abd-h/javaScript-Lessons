Copy Array Items Using slice()

The next method we will cover is slice(). Rather than modifying an array, 
slice() copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array, leaving 
the array it is called upon untouched. slice() takes only 2 parameters â€” the first 
is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop 
extraction (extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index). 
Consider this:*/

let weatherConditions = ["rain"," snow", "sleet", "hail", "clear"];
let todaysWeather = weatherConditions.slice(1, 3); //snow and sleet;

/*todaysWeather would have the value ['snow', 'sleet'], while weatherConditions 
would still have ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'].

In effect, we have created a new array by extracting elements from an existing array.
------------------------------------------------------------

We have defined a function, forecast, that takes an array as an argument. Modify the function using slice() to extract information from the argument array and return a new array that contains the string elements warm and sunny.

forecast should return ["warm", "sunny"]

The forecast function should utilize the slice() method

function forecast(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line

  return arr;
}

// Only change code above this line
console.log(forecast(['cold', 'rainy', 'warm', 'sunny', 'cool', 'thunderstorms']));*/

function forecast(arr) {
    return arr.slice(2,4);
}
console.log(forecast(['cold', 'rainy', 'warm', 'sunny', 'cool', 'thunderstorms']));

/*      Copy an Array with the Spread Operator

While slice() allows us to be selective about what elements of an array to copy, 
among several other useful tasks, ES6's new spread operator allows us to easily 
copy all of an array's elements, in order, with a simple and highly readable syntax. 
The spread syntax simply looks like this: ...

In practice, we can use the spread operator to copy an array like so:
*/
let thisArray = [true, true, undefined,false, null];
let thatArray = [...thisArray];
console.log(thatArray);

/*  thatArray equals [true, true, undefined, false, null]. 
thisArray remains unchanged and thatArray contains the same elements as thisArray.
------------------------------------------------------------

We have defined a function, copyMachine which takes arr (an array) 
and num (a number) as arguments. The function is supposed to return 
a new array made up of num copies of arr. We have done most of the work for you, 
but it doesn't work quite right yet. Modify the function using spread syntax so that it
 works correctly (hint: another method we have already covered might come in handy here!).

copyMachine([true, false, true], 2) should return [[true, false, true], [true, false, true]]

copyMachine([1, 2, 3], 5) should return [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]

copyMachine([true, true, null], 1) should return [[true, true, null]]

copyMachine(["it works"], 3) should return [["it works"], ["it works"], ["it works"]]

The copyMachine function should utilize the spread operator with array arr


function copyMachine(arr, num) {
  let newArr = [];
  while (num >= 1) {
    // Only change code below this line

    // Only change code above this line
    num--;
  }
  return newArr;
}


*/
function copyMachine(arr, num) {
    let newArr = [];
    while(num >= 1) {
        newArr.push([...arr]);
        num--;
    }
    return newArr;
}
console.log(copyMachine([true, false, true], 2));

/*      Combine Arrays with the Spread Operator

Another huge advantage of the spread operator is the ability to combine arrays, or 
to insert all the elements of one array into another, at any index. With more traditional syntaxes, 
we can concatenate arrays, but this only allows us to combine arrays at the end of one, and at the start of another. Spread syntax makes the following operation extremely simple:
*/
let oldArray = ["sage", "rosemery", "parsley", "thyme"];
let ingredientArray = ["basil", "cilantro", ...oldArray, "coriander"];
console.log(ingredientArray);

/*thatArray would have the value ['basil', 'cilantro', 'sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme', 'coriander'].

Using spread syntax, we have just achieved an operation that would have been more complex 
and more verbose had we used traditional methods.

We have defined a function spreadOut that returns the variable sentence. 
Modify the function using the spread operator so that it returns the 
array ['learning', 'to', 'code', 'is', 'fun'].

function spreadOut() {
  let fragment = ['to', 'code'];
  let sentence; // Change this line
  return sentence;
}

console.log(spreadOut());*/

function spreadOut() {
    let fragment = ["to", "code"];
    let  sentence  = ["learning",...fragment, "is", "fun"];
    return sentence
}
console.log(spreadOut());
