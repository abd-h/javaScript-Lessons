    <h1>Basic Data Structures</h1>
    <p>
        
        Data can be stored and accessed in many ways. You already know some common JavaScript data structures â€” arrays and
        objects.
        
        In this Basic Data Structures course, you'll learn more about the differences between arrays and objects, and which to
        use in different situations. You'll also learn how to use helpful JS methods like splice() and Object.keys() to access
        and manipulate data.
