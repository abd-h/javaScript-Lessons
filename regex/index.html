        Regular Expressions#
        Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp", are patterns that help programmers match, search, and
        replace text. Regular expressions are very powerful, but can be hard to read because they use special characters to make
        more complex, flexible matches.
        
        In this course, you'll learn how to use special characters, capture groups, positive and negative lookaheads, and other
        techniques to match any text you want.
