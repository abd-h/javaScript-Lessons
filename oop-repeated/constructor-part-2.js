There is one crucial side effect of manually setting the prototype to a new object. 
It erases the constructor property! This property can be used to check

/*Understand Where an Objectâ€™s Prototype Comes From

Just like people inherit genes from their parents, an object inherits 
its prototype directly from the constructor function that created it. 
For example, here the Bird constructor creates the duck object:*/

function BirdII(name){
    this.name = name;
}
let duckII = new BirdII("Donald");
/*duck inherits its prototype from the Bird constructor function. 
You can show this relationship with the isPrototypeOf method:
*/
